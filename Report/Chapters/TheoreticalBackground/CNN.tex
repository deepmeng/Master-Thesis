\subsubsection*{Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)}

Convolutional Neural Networks are similar to normal Neural Networks. They are made up of neurons that have learn able weights and biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, perform a dot product and sometimes follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network expresses a single differentiable score function - from raw image pixels to class scores. CNN architectures make the assumption that the image is, which make it possible to encode certain properties into the architecture. It makes the forward function more efficient to implement and reduce the amount of parameters in the network
