\section{Acceleration}\label{sectionAcceleration}
The acceleration is another important parameter in this project. It became important because in the start of the project, the agent has to learn how to accelerate itself. The agent with discrete actions didn't learn the right policy with having the acceleration as an trainable parameter. Acceleration was then changed from an trainable parameter to a constant parameter.

This was done to see if it was possible for the agent to learn how to drive a lap on different speed. This was done because it could be more realistic if it is possible to see the car driving faster than 10 km/h. The tested speed was with an interval of 20 km/h:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 10 km/h
	\item 30 km/h
	\item 50 km/h
\end{itemize} 

The way the car was driving these average speed, was first the car accelerate to a speed of desired speed - 30 km/h example. After this the acceleration is constant so the speed always stays at 30 km/h. The car will try to stay at the desired speed (30 km/h) the whole lap. To accelerate it is the throttle in the environment which needed to be changed.

To test the acceleration influence on the agent learning, all other parameters is as described in the introduction to this \Cref{cha:Result}. Thereby it should be possible to only see the influence on the acceleration.

The most important graph is the graph of the reward, which looks different from all the acceleration, this graph can be seen on \Cref{fig:change_of_acceleration_reward_graph}.

\end{figure} 


On \Cref{fig:change_of_acceleration_reward_graph} it is possible to see what happens with the different accelerations. By looking at the first speed 10 km/h, it is the one used in the start of this \Cref{cha:Result}.

To compare the speed 10 km/h with the 30 km/h the agent seems to learn how to drive at booth speed. Both speed conjugate at some reward. A speed of 10 km/h at around a reward of 11, and a speed of 30 km/h around a reward of 8. The different value of the reward is because of the different speeds, because the speed is taken into account in the reward function as seen in \Cref{sectionReward}. 

The speed of 10 km/h and 30 km/h also have different stabilities, as the 10 km/h looks to be more stable around a reward of 11. With the speed of 30 km/h the reward seems to be unstable, because it is more unstable around 8.

By looking at the training time of the two speeds 10 km/h and 30 km/h it looks like a speed of 10 km/h is learning faster. It is learning faster in time-steps, because it doesn't need as many time-steps as a speed of 30 km/h to learn. But every time-step with a speed of 30 km/h goes faster than a speed of 10 km/h, this is due to the time of the time-step to end or episodes to end. As mentioned earlier an episode ends when the car drives out of the track, the car drives backwards or the car finish a lap. With having a speed of 30 km/h the car will drive faster, and thereby will the episodes be shorter. To compare the training time the graph on \Cref{fig:change_of_acceleration_reward_graph} isn't sufficient, so another graph with hours instead of time-steps is created and can be seen on \Cref{fig:change_of_acceleration_reward_hours_graph}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figures/Result/change_of_acceleration_reward_hours_graph.pdf}
	\caption{Comparison of the three different speed with the reward getting from the environment. Here it is the time in hours, instead of time-steps on the x-axis}
	\label{fig:change_of_acceleration_reward_hours_graph}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:change_of_acceleration_reward_hours_graph} shows that the learning time in hours is close to being the same, for both a speed of 10 km/h and 30 km/h. Both speeds conjugate after 3 hours of training, thereby there is no different in the learning time for 10 km/h and 30 km/h.

By looking at the learned agent driving in the TORCS environment, it is seen that at 10 km/h and 30 km/h the car has learned how to drive a lap on the track. It is easy to see that the stability at the speed 30 km/h is not as good as the stability at a speed of 10 km/h. The car on 30 km/h makes bigger turns, which means it gets closer to the edge. The 10 km/h drives more smoothly in the center of the tack. 

As seen on both \Cref{fig:change_of_acceleration_reward_graph} and \Cref{fig:change_of_acceleration_reward_hours_graph} at a speed of 50 km/h, the agent doesn't learn how to drive. It never conjugate to the best reward, it seems that it is learning something but never continues learning. After looking at the agent in the TORCS environment it is also seen that the agent don't learn how to drive as seen from the graphs.  

This problem with not learning on a speed of 50 km/h, could be due to the discrete values for steering send as a discrete action. This discrete action maybe needed to be adjusted to different speed, because with higher speed the steering has more influence on the car than on lower speeds. This could maybe also solve the problem with the stability with a speed of 30 km/h. 

The conclusion by looking at the results from the different speed is that the agent performs better at a speed of 10 km/h and there by is the used speed for the best algorithm.
