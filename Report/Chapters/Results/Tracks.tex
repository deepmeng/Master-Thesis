\section{Tracks}
In the TORCS environment is it possible to change the tracks the car is racing in. This is done, to see how it will effect the training. The different tracks is also used for testing. It is possible to test if the car has learned how to drive, by training the car on one track, and then testing it on another track. The car should then be able to drive on both track.
